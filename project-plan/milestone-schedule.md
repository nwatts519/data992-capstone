# Project Plan and Milestone Schedule

This document serves as the official roadmap for the DATA 992 Capstone project. It outlines specific deliverables and acceptance criteria for the anomaly detection project, aligned with the 13-module course structure.

---

## Phase 1: Initiation and Foundation
**Focus:** Team alignment and operational standards.

| Module | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Journaling Start** | Initial accomplishments and goals recorded individually. |
| **02** | **Team Process Agreement** | Signed document outlining roles, tools (Python/PowerBI), and communication plan. |

## Phase 2: Definition and Research
**Focus:** Scoping the anomaly detection problem and planning data acquisition.

### Module 03: Problem Statement
* Update to the root README.md on GitHub.
* **Criteria**: Concise definition of project scope, stakeholder needs, and known constraints.

### Module 04: Individual Data Plan
* Individual definition of required data, collection methods, and cleaning expectations.

### Module 05: Individual Literature Review
* Research list with a minimum of 5 references per student.

### Module 06: Group Data Plan and Literature Review
* Consolidated GitHub update with a minimum of 10 background references.
* **Criteria**: Technical data dictionary defining structures and naming conventions.

---

## Phase 3: Strategy and Presentation
**Focus:** Formalizing methodology and stakeholder alignment.

### Module 07: Project Plan
* Detailed methodology for unsupervised/adaptive modeling and a formal schedule.

### Module 08: Plan Presentation
* ~10-minute team presentation of the project plan.
* **Criteria**: Presentation link added to the GitHub project page.

## Phase 4: Implementation and Visualization
**Focus:** Executing analysis and building the PowerBI artifact.

| Module | Deliverable | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **09** | **Group Status Report** | Individual summary of accomplishments with Green/Amber/Red status. |
| **10** | **Data Visualization** | Illustrative charts in PowerBI/Seaborn highlighting anomalies. |
| **11** | **Data Analysis** | Technical documentation of model techniques and insights extracted. |

---

## Phase 5: Final Delivery
**Focus:** Polishing the artifact and closing the project.

### Module 12: Final Presentation
* ~20-minute presentation including methodology, visualizations, and a live demo.

### Module 13: Final Project Page Edits
* Incorporate stakeholder/instructor feedback and polish for clarity and organization.

### Module 13: Peer Reviews
* Individual evaluation of self and team members, including strengths and improvement areas.

## Internal Risk Mitigation

> **Technical Safeguard**: All Jira tasks have internal deadlines 48 hours before the official Canvas submission to allow for team troubleshooting and peer review.

* **Accuracy**: All updates will be evaluated for truthfulness and technical correctness.
* **Organization**: The repository will remain well-structured and logical to meet university rubric standards.
